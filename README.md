Stripboard-PID-Arduino-Shield-Hardware
======================================

This project was inspired by the osPID (open source PID, http://www.osPID.com) and is indebted to that pioneering device in every possible way.

The goal was to design a PID controller that could be built from individual components with minimal skill and know-how. With this in mind, the hardware design attempted to recreate as much as possible of the functionality of osPID on a hand-soldered prototype board using through-hole components.

Two possibilities are implemented for the temperature sensor: an analogue thermistor, or the digital DS18B20. These options limit the maximum temperature to 125Â°C or so.

The materials, apart from the Arduino itself, can all be sourced from Tayda (http://www.taydaelectronics.com).
